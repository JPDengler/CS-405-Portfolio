# CS-405 Portfolio

This repository showcases my work in CS-405: Secure Coding, focusing on secure coding practices, risk assessment, and security policy implementation. Each project highlights a unique aspect of security in software development, including policy creation, vulnerability mitigation, and adherence to secure coding standards.

## Contents

### Major Projects

- **[Project One: Security Policy](Project%20One.docx)**  
  Project One involved developing a comprehensive security policy for a fictitious organization. This policy addresses critical aspects of cybersecurity, including risk management, access control, and data protection. The document covers essential policies to guide the secure development and maintenance of applications, helping the organization meet regulatory compliance and prevent security breaches.

- **[Project Two: Secure Coding Standards and Presentation](Project%20Two%20Presentation.pptx)**  
  In Project Two, I developed a presentation and script detailing 10 essential secure coding principles and aligned coding standards. The presentation addresses topics like input validation, compiler warnings, least privilege, and defense in depth. This project highlights the importance of embedding security throughout the development lifecycle rather than as a final step. It serves as a guide for developers to adhere to industry best practices and mitigate risks associated with common vulnerabilities.

- **[Project Two Script](Project%20Two%20Script.docx)**  
  Accompanying the presentation, this script provides a narrative structure to convey the secure coding standards and principles effectively, offering context for each principle and its practical application in real-world scenarios.

- **[Journal Reflection on Secure Coding](Journal%20Week%208%20-%20Joseph%20Dengler.docx)**  
  A reflective piece discussing my understanding and insights on adopting secure coding standards, the zero-trust model, and the importance of implementing security policies from the outset. The journal provides an introspective view on how these practices enhance application security and protect organizational assets.

### Coding Projects
Each of these coding projects demonstrates secure coding principles and vulnerability mitigation strategies in C/C++.

- **[BufferOverflowActivity.zip](Coding%20Projects/BufferOverflowActivity.zip)**  
  This project focuses on preventing buffer overflow vulnerabilities, a significant security concern. Through input validation and memory management, this activity showcases techniques to prevent unauthorized access or crashes due to buffer mismanagement.

- **[EncryptionActivity.zip](Coding%20Projects/EncryptionActivity.zip)**  
  An exercise in implementing encryption methods to protect sensitive data. This project reinforces the concept of data confidentiality, ensuring information security during storage and transmission.

- **[ExceptionsActivity.zip](Coding%20Projects/ExceptionsActivity.zip)**  
  Highlights secure exception handling to prevent application crashes or unauthorized access caused by improper error handling. This project emphasizes graceful error management without exposing sensitive information.

- **[ModuleFourMilestone.zip](Coding%20Projects/ModuleFourMilestone.zip)**  
  A milestone project integrating secure coding techniques across multiple modules. It brings together input validation, memory management, and error handling to create a resilient application architecture.

- **[MyBufferOverflowApp.zip](Coding%20Projects/MyBufferOverflowApp.zip)**  
  Builds on the Buffer Overflow Activity, demonstrating secure memory handling and input validation practices to prevent common memory-related vulnerabilities.

- **[SQLInjectionActivity.zip](Coding%20Projects/SQLInjectionActivity.zip)**  
  This project addresses SQL injection vulnerabilities, showcasing techniques like input sanitization and query parameterization to protect database integrity.

- **[StaticCodeActivity.zip](Coding%20Projects/StaticCodeActivity.zip)**  
  A static code analysis project that uses Cppcheck to detect and mitigate security vulnerabilities. This project highlights the importance of regular code review and vulnerability scanning as a proactive security measure.

## Secure Coding Principles and Standards

These principles guided my approach throughout the projects:

1. **Validate Input Data**: Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
2. **Heed Compiler Warnings**: Address compiler warnings to avoid vulnerabilities.
3. **Architect for Security**: Incorporate encryption and access controls in design.
4. **Keep It Simple**: Minimize complexity to reduce attack surfaces.
5. **Default Deny**: Deny access by default to limit unauthorized actions.
6. **Least Privilege**: Restrict permissions to reduce the potential impact of a breach.
7. **Sanitize Data Sent to Other Systems**: Prevent external vulnerabilities.
8. **Defense in Depth**: Layer multiple security mechanisms for robust defense.
9. **Quality Assurance**: Continuous testing and code analysis for early vulnerability detection.
10. **Adopt a Secure Coding Standard**: Follow industry standards like SEI CERT for consistency and security.
